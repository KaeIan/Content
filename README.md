# Content

This Content Repo is designed for blog posts and other written content.

I needed a version controlled way of storing my content. I have worked with markdown frequently and found there are enough libraries to render this quite reliably out into html. It enables me to work on it nicely locally and then push up the changes, with it all being pre styled onto the website.
