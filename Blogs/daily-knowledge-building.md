As a Software Engineer, you should be constantly learning. Technology is rapidly evolving and if you want to be effective at your job you need to adopt a growth mindset. On the job training is great experience, but it does not always provide deeper understanding of software methodologies. For this you need to immerse yourself in the wider software engineering community and frequently aim to expand your knowledge.

I recommend developing a curated list of quality resources which you can browse and consume as part of your daily routine. Blogs and YouTube channels are particularly effective learning instruments.

The following software blogs will help you get started:

* [Microsoft Devblogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/){target="__blank"} - The Microsoft dev blogs include tips, tutorials and upcoming features for Azure, PowerShell, Visual Studio, .NET, Windows Commandline and more.
* [Trello Blog](https://blog.trello.com/){target="__blank"} - Productivity and team tips.
* [The Wolf Report](https://michael-wolfenden.github.io/){target="__blank"} - Daily curated links to interesting blog posts across the software industry.
* [Visual Studio Code Blog](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/){target="__blank"} - Useful Visual Studio Code tips and tricks.
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/){target="__blank"} - Daily collection of technology related articles.

You may wish to add industry specific (health, finance, etc.) resources to this list if you want to consider problems from a business perspective and communicate more effectively with your customer. Consuming these resources regularly will rapidly build your understanding and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby augmenting the quality of your engineering solutions.
